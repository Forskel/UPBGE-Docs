History
-------

The **Uchronia Project Blender Game Engine** (UPBGE) is a `Blender <https://www.blender.org/>`__'s builtin tool for 
real-time projects, from architectural visualizations and simulations to games.

Originally a fork from the Blender Foundation's `Blender Game Engine <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_Game_Engine>`__, became indepent 
with the Blender Foundation's announcement of BGE's removal and replacement with a 
new Interactive Engine. With this independency, the UPBGE's developers have freedom 
to change and add features that could not be changed before (because the possibility 
of an official Blender merge, now discarded).

Features
--------

UPBGE have lots of `new features <https://doc.upbge.org/releases.php>`__, improvements 
and bugs fixed that BGE haven't. Some features that UPBGE supports are:

- Realtime advanced physics, including rigid bodies, soft bodies, obstacle simulation and path finding.
- Fully integrated audio engine, with support to 3D sound and simple sound effects (fades, hi/low pass, etc).
- Easy and straightforward visual logic system and powerful `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ language bindings.
- Development process entirely inside Blender, without needing to import/export models and textures.
- Game can be executed in Blender viewport or on an standalone executable.
- Supports Blender's `Linked Libraries <https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/data_system/linked_libraries.html>`__ feature, allowing to organize projects in multiple blend files.
